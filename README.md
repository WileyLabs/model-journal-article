# Model Journal Article

The Model Journal Article (MJA) is intended to provide a ready reference for a broad range of content use cases that fall under the general rubric of scholarly publishing. It is not a comprehensive set of use cases, but it does provide a useful benchmark when comparing various scholarly publishing formats.

The Model Journal Article is the fruit of many years of experience in scholarly publishing at [John Wiley & Sons](https://wiley.com/). We are making it publicly available (along with Wiley's [Melville](Melville/) version of it) to encourage further collaboration among various formats for publishing scholarly research.

We welcome pull requests of other incarnations of the MJA in any format intended for scholarly publication!

> *Please Note:* absolutely no attention has been paid to narrative coherence in the content, and no meaning whatsoever should be inferred from the juxtaposition of the samples.

## Sources & copyright

The content of the Model Journal Article was taken from a number of Wiley-owned sources over a period of years. To the best of our ability, we have referenced the source material below. If we have missed something, please let us know!

While the MJA example content and format expressions are freely available, the copyright of the original content, as well as any vocabularies used in any MJA markup, remains with their original owners.

Additionally, since our remit was to find representative content over any other considerations, much of the source material is not open access, so you may not be able to access the full reference.
