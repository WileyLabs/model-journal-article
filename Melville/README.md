# Melville

At Wiley, we have developed an HTML format, internally referred to as _Melville_. The starting point for this was a lossless rendering of our XML format, WileyML, from which we produce various other XML formats, such as JATS. The HTML structure is augmented with [RDFa](http://rdfa.info/) that provides a semantic context for the underlying content.

## Sources & copyright

Please see the main [README](../README.md) for attributions related to the content of the Model Journal Article.

This Melville variant makes use of publicly available vocabularies in its RDFa-encoded content, as well as terms created by Wiley.
